                <p>
                ​Aya is a visual communications design major at San Francisco State University. Beyond her studies, she works as a digital marketer, web designer, and fundraising consultant
                at the <a href="https://ssfedfoundation.org">South San Francisco Education Foundation</a>.  Aya aims to pursue a career in UX/UI design, focusing on organizations or companies 
                that uplift and empower minorities.​ <br>
                <br>
                Her artistic interests are diverse, which includes various hobbies. A music enthusiast, Aya plays four instruments: guitar, bass, drums,
                and ukulele, with her favorite genres being rock, alternative, and indie. She dedicates a lot of time to music-related activities, from listening to her favorite songs to creating 
                her own music! <br> 
                <br>
                In addition to music, Aya finds peace in painting, often creating natural elements like clouds, trees, and flowers. She enjoys experimenting with different 
                brushing techniques for a therapeutic experience. When she wants to avoid the mess that comes with painting, Aya often uses her Wacom tablet to create digital art, appreciating 
                the flexibility it offers in experimenting with elements and layers.​
