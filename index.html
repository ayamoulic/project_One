        <p> Hi I’m Aya! I am a visual communications design major here at San Francisco State University. Outside of school, I am a digital marketer, web designer, <br>
        and fundraising consultant at <a href="https://ssfedfoundation.org">South San Francisco Education Foundation</a>. My goal is to pursue a career in UX/UI design, specifically for an organization <br>
        or company that empowers minorities. My passion for arts expands to many other categories, which I consider my hobbies. I love music and play 4 different <br>
        instruments, guitar, bass, drums, and ukulele. My favorite genres of music are soul, rock, and alternative. I spend a lot of time doing music related stuff, <br>
        from simply listening to my favorite songs or creating my own music! <br>
        <br>
        Aside from music, I enjoy painting in my free time. I often paint natural elements like clouds, trees, and flowers because I find it very therapeutic with<br>
        the different brushing techniques I use. I have been painting since kindergarten and I am very familiar with painting landscape art, so it is just what I am <br>
        familiar with the most. If I don’t want to get my hands dirty, I will use my handy Wacom tablet to create funky art. I love the convenience of digital art <br>
        because you can really experiment with different elements and layers. 
        </p>
