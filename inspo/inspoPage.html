            honest, with soft melodies and poetic lyrics. His ability to <br>

            his music inspiring. His sound feels personal and intimate,<br> 
            which makes his songs easy to connect with. He is one of<br>
            Aya’s biggest inspirations, especially in how she applies <br>
            these characteristics to her own music. </p>

            unpredictable, blending lo-fi sounds with unique melodies <br>
            and cryptic lyrics. His ability to shift between genres while<br>
            maintaining a deeply personal feel makes his music <br>

            honesty and nostalgia.</p>
